# Intro

Monetizing Digital Content is a massive challenge and requires not just understanding of the marketplace but also the distribution of the content. With more and more marketplaces created, and in modern media ownership in the modern age is challenge distribution is key to being relevant. Blockchain provides a new alternative to a traditional content platform such as FB & Google. 

Blockchain/NFT has grown beyond the hype, Just in the Year 2021 it's grown to $23 Billion, In response to this massive growth, both individual creators and firms as wide-ranging as retail, music, entertainment, consumer products, fashion, and more have begun actively exploring ways to engage with the world of NFTs.

Unlike the traditional aggregators, NFT marketplaces are inherently open and would always be innovating through newer blockchain. Since NFTs are built on a fully public blockchain
infrastructure, most transaction data is publicly available, limiting the extent to which these platforms can build the kinds of data moats that lead to monopolies

# The Idea

In addition, the success of augmented platforms suggests that differentiation is highly valuable to both buyers and sellers. We’re already seeing that there’s strong demand for multiple coexisting NFT marketplaces, each focused on a different domain and offering specialized tools to help their partners succeed. Even within industries, multiple platforms can coexist, as long as they differentiate in the tools and experiences that they provide. Setu wants to connect these marketplaces and provide tools to not just create/MINT NFTs but also distribute them to various marketplaces. We want to be able to provide tools, platforms and reduce the burden of publishing, dropping/scheduling, running campaigns, collaborating, etc. We aim to provide analytics, engagement, and token diversity (Sol, ETH, Tezos)
